The `blaze-builder` library: an abstraction of buffered output
==============================================================


This first blog post about the `blaze-builder` library features a simple usage
example to get you acquinted with the library as well as a comparison of the
performance between `blaze-builder` and `binary`.

In the next blog post, I will then explain how the `blaze-builder` library is
implemented.  Intuitively, its implementation can be seen as a neat abstraction of
buffered output. However, more about that in the next post.

Creating your own builders

Future work

improve binary combine with attoparsec
move to 'Data.ByteString.Builder' and 'bytestring-builder' package, if
community thinks this is a good idea.
encode vs. serialize
